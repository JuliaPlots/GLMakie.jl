install_tips = """
OpenGL/GLFW wasn't installed correctly. This likely means,
you don't have an OpenGL capable Graphic Card,
you don't have the newest video driver installed,
or the GLFW build failed. If you're on linux and `]build` GLFW failed,
try manually adding `sudo apt-get install libglfw3` and then `]build GLMakie`.
If you're on a headless server, you still need to install x-server and
proper GPU drivers. You can take inspiration from this article
on how to get Makie running on a headless system:
https://nextjournal.com/sdanisch/makie-1.0
If you don't have a GPU, there is also a Cairo software backend
for Makie which you can use:
https://github.com/JuliaPlots/CairoMakie.jl.
Please check the below error and open an issue at:
https://github.com/JuliaPlots/GLMakie.jl.
After you fixed your OpenGL install, please run `]build GLMakie` again!
GLMakie will still load, but will be disabled as a default backend for Makie
